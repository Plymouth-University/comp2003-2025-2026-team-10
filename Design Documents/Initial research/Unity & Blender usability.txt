Unity
Unity would be a good engine for simulation as it features built-in physically based rendering and physics simulation, can handle collisions and supports particle 
systems. It can also be customised through third-party tools if needed so has high flexibility. It supports both real-time and pre-rendered simulations. It has GPU 
acceleration capabilities which can improve simulation performance which makes it suitable for large-scale simulations. Furthermore, it has a large user base and 
heavy documentation so any troubleshooting that may turn up should not be as much of an issue. However, if it is not properly optimised it can become heavily 
demanding.


Blender
As an alternative, Blender would be good for simulation as it has built-in tools for fluid, particle and soft or rigid body simulation. It also supports physics-
driven effects and excels in pre-rendered simulations. It can be integrated with external physics engines and solvers. In addition, it would provide a high-quality 
physics-based simulation which can be optimised through GPU acceleration, baked physics and adaptive resolution. However, it is less suitable for large scale 
simulations and it requires baking for most physics which will make working on iterations much slower than in Unity.



Exporting to Unity:
A ParaView project can be indirectly imported by first exporting an OBJ sequence to Blender. From the Blender project the FBX file can be exported to the Unity 
project.


Exporting to Blender:
For ParaView the geometry must be exported in a suitable file type, such as a OBJ, which can then be imported directly to Blender.

Exporting from Unity to Blender can be done by importing the FBX file from Unity into Blender.
