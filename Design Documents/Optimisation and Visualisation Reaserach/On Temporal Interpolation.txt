//Temporal Interpolation//

It is possible to reduce the storage heft of wind turbine simulation data (visualised via ParaView, but Unity in our context) by implementing temporal interpolation, which can be understood as storing less (key) timesteps and then reconstructing intermediate frames.

The goal for this, is to reduce the end size of the dataset as much as we can without any degradation of simulation fidelity.

Storing every timestep is unnecessary because fluid motion is varied smoothly over time, meaning significant portions of the data, can be destroyed and interpolated. Of course, before our client picked us, some time ago another student discovered a way of reducing the CFD simulation's file size using Unity. Whether this (Temporal interpolation) can be consistently applied using unity is as of now, not something I could do tomorrow (to my current knowledge of my own experience and know-how of Unity)

Key Principles include:

- Maintain animation continuity with as little computational cost.

- Save limited frames (every Nth frame/timestep).

- Reconstruct intermediate frames using interpolation.

I am currently researching data reduction implementation methods utilising this concept (in both ParaView/openFOAM, and within Unity itself).
