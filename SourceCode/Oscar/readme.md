After creating a new Unity project replace the original Assets folder with this one *. Once the Asset folder has been
replaced, run the Unity project and select the Visualize scene. The project can then be ran and play the animation.


* Ensure that all ZIPs in the new Assets/Objects folder have been extracted where necessary.
