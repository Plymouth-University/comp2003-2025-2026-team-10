VAWT Data explained


•	U : Velocity field (fluid flow). This data is used for visualizing the interaction between the wind and the wind turbine.

•	p, p_rgh : Pressure and reduced hydrostatic pressure. This data is used to compute and calculate the forces on blades.

•	pointDisplacement : Mesh deformation or solid body motion. This file contains blade motion data.

•	coupledForceField : Likely contains forces (pressure, viscous) on the turbine surface which are critical for analysing torque and power.

•	alpha.water : Volume fraction for multiphase (water/air). If simulating air only flow, this may be irrelevant.

•	k, omega, nut : Turbulence fields (k ω SST model). Needed for accurate flow dynamics.

•	phi, meshphi, Uf : Flux fields across cell faces. Used in solving momentum equations.

•	alphaphi0.water : Phase flux for multiphase, this is likely not needed if only air flow is being simulated.

•	rAU : Reciprocal of momentum predictor matrix diagonal. Not likely to be needed for this visualization/simulation.

•	uniform folder : Contains global simulation properties (time, deltaT, etc.). Necessary for time series reconstruction.

•	polyMesh folder : Mesh topology (points, faces, cells). Required to interpret all field data.
